## **Dungeon Run** - *In the search of the Lost Kebab*

- I (Alex) might be able to fix the map/rooms. Don't know how yet...
- Not the best one explaining things but i can do some work in the background.
- Jarl allready started with the heavy python stuff, aka OOP.
- We need a menu, that can be simple or hard to solve.
- A Player class that can be used to create a player.
- A monster class that can be used to create a monster.
- A room/map class that can be used to create a room/map.
- Increase the complexity of the game by adding more rooms, monsters, items, etc.
