## Easy, medium and hard

The player is in _red_, exit is _yellow_.
The root window stays the same, but the size of the dungeon changes. Before i was changing even the root but that was messing with the menu. So it will stay like this until i find a better solution.

## Pathway

The pathway is mostly a marker that shows the player where he has been.

## End of the dungeon

When the player reaches the end of the dungeon, the game ends. I will have to add a popup that says something like "You won!". For now the game will return to the [intro screen](#intro).
