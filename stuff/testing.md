# Geting the virtual environment set up

I set up the environment for testing with TOX. Pytest and Unittest are on the way.

Yo must follow the instructions below to get the environment set up. Or find the ones for your OS. I'm using a Mac.

---

## VS Code for Mac

- Open the terminal in your project folder (in VS Code)
- python3 -m venv venv
- source .venv/bin/activate
- pip install -r requirements.txt

---

## Tox

I'm using Python 3.11 but in requiremts.txt I put a link for 3.10 so it will not matter what version you have installed.
But i recommand you to upgrade to 3.11, is faster and the error messages are better.

- run **tox** in the terminal

---

## Pytest

- run **pytest** in the terminal

---

## Unittest

- run **python -m unittest** in the terminal
