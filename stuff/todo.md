## **Dungeon Run** - *In the search of the Lost Kebab*

- Jarl already started with the heavy python stuff, aka OOP. A bit of polishing and we are ready to go.
- We need a menu, that can be simple or hard to solve (hard to solve, means easy to use/look's good)
- A player class that can be used to create a player, already started by Jarl.
- A monster class that can be used to create a monster, already started by Jarl.
- Maybe a class for items? Dind'nt check but it might be already started by Jarl as well.
- A room/map class that can be used to create a room/map.
- Increase the complexity of the game by adding more rooms, monsters, items, etc.
- We will try to keep it simple and not overcomplicate things.
