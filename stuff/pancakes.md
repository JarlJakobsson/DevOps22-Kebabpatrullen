To make pancakes, you will need the following ingredients:

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon white sugar
1 1/4 cups milk
1 egg
3 tablespoons butter, melted
Here's how to make the pancakes:

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Make a well in the center of the mixture.
In a separate bowl, beat the egg and then stir in the milk and melted butter. Pour the wet ingredients into the well in the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.
Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly oil the surface.
Scoop about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook the pancakes for about 2 minutes, or until bubbles form on the surface and the edges are starting to look dry.
Flip the pancakes and cook for an additional minute, or until the other side is golden brown.
Serve the pancakes with your favorite toppings, such as syrup, butter, fruit, or chocolate chips. Enjoy!
