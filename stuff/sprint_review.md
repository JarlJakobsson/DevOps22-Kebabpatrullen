---

Because of lack of knowledge about *Agile Development*, we started with a waterfall approach. We created a flowchart, kanban board and a project timeline. We also created a README.md and used github to collaborate on code and documentation.

But more we learned we realized that we needed to change our approach. We created a product backlog, a sprint backlog, user stories and a sprint review and retrospective. We used Trello to create the kanban board and to keep track of our progress. We used Miro, Lucid and Mermaid to create the flowchart and the project timeline. We used github to collaborate on code, link sharing, updates and documentation.
