## Agile Project Management

**Dungeon Run** - *In the search of the Lost Kebab*

- The project is a 2 "**one week sprint**" project
- Communication is done through Discord, Trello and Zoom
- Coding is done in pairs as long as *Jarl* is doing the heavy lifting ;)
- Raffi will provide the kebab and the beer
- Don't forget to have fun!
