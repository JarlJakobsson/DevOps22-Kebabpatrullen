## GUI - _Graphical User Interface_ ðŸš§

We focused our efforts on the terminal version of the game, but we also tryed to implement a GUI version of the game. The GUI version is not finished yet, but we are working on it. Maybe we will finish it on the next sprint ðŸ˜€

## Testing - _Unit Testing_ using _Pytest_ and _Unittest_

We have implemented unit testing for the game. We have used _Pytest_ and _Unittest_ to test the game. We have also implemented a coverage report to see how much of the code is covered by the tests.

## Flowchart

We managed to create flowcharts for the game on 3 different ways. We used Lucidchart, Mermaid and Miro. Lucidchart and Miro are online tools, and Mermaid is a markdown extension. We used Lucidchart and Miro to create the flowcharts, and we used Mermaid to create the flowchart in this README file.

## Kanban Board

We used Trello to create a Kanban board for the project. We used the Kanban board to manage the project and to keep track of the tasks. We also used the Kanban board for our sprint retrospectives.
